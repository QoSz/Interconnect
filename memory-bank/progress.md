# Progress: Interconnect

## Project Status: Early Development

The project is currently in early development, with the basic structure and homepage implemented. The foundation has been laid for expanding the site with additional content and functionality.

## What Works

- Basic site structure and navigation
- Home page with hero section, services overview, and call-to-action
- Individual service pages (initial versions)
- About page content structure
- Contact page redesigned with two-column layout, dark theme cards, and functional Web3Forms submission (direct key in code)
- Core Memory Bank files established
- **404 Not Found page implemented**

## What's Left to Build

- **Content Refinement:** Review and finalize all page content for accuracy, tone, and SEO.
- **Advanced Animations:** Implement more subtle animations on scroll/interaction where appropriate.
- **Contact Form Backend:** Connect the contact form to an email service or backend endpoint.
- **Blog/Portfolio Section:** (If required)
- **Responsiveness Polish:** Thorough testing and refinement across all device sizes.
- **Performance Optimization:** Image optimization, code splitting, etc.
- **Accessibility Check:** Ensure WCAG compliance.
- **Testing:** Implement unit/integration tests.

## Current Status

- Core pages are structurally complete but require content finalization and polish.
- Development environment is stable.
- Focus is shifting towards content accuracy and feature refinement.

## Known Issues

- Contact form currently relies on Web3Forms (no custom backend/CRM yet).
- Some placeholder text may still exist.
- Performance hasn't been specifically optimized yet.
- Factual accuracy of the 'Our Story' section was corrected (previously mentioned meeting 'in the same city', now corrected to 'Cardiff').

## Upcoming Milestones
1. **Complete Core Pages** - Finish all main service pages with content
2. **Implement Contact Functionality** - Make contact form fully functional
3. **Finalize Design** - Ensure consistent design across all pages
4. **Initial Launch** - Deploy MVP version
5. **Analytics & Optimization** - Post-launch improvements

## Success Indicators
- All planned pages implemented with final content
- Responsive design working across all target devices
- Form submissions working correctly
- Animations performing smoothly
- Site loading quickly (meeting performance targets)
