# System Patterns: Interconnect

## Architecture Overview
Interconnect is built using a modern frontend architecture with Next.js as the core framework. The application follows the App Router pattern introduced in Next.js 13+, with a focus on component-based development and client/server component separation.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Next.js App Router
- Uses the latest `/app` directory structure
- Leverages server components for improved performance
- Implements client components where interactivity is needed
- Takes advantage of file-based routing for organization

### Component Structure
- **Organized by Feature**: Components are grouped by feature/page (home, about, services)
- **Shared Components**: Reusable components are stored in a shared directory
- **UI Components**: Basic UI elements are isolated in a UI directory for reusability
- **Component Composition**: Pages are composed of multiple smaller, specialized components

### Design System
- Implements a consistent design system through TailwindCSS
- Uses utility-first approach for styling
- Leverages component variants for consistent UI elements
- Incorporates responsive design principles throughout

### Animation Strategy
- Client-side animations for interactive elements
- CSS animations for simple transitions
- Framer Motion for more complex animations
- Typing/text animations for engaging user experience

### State Management
- Local component state for UI interactions
- React hooks for state management
- No global state management solution yet implemented

## Data Flow Patterns

### Static Content
- Content is primarily static and built into the components
- No CMS integration currently implemented
- Future plans may include dynamic content fetching

### Form Handling
- Client-side form validation
- Form submissions handled through client components
- Contact form will eventually connect to backend services

## Routing Strategy
- Page-based routing through Next.js file system
- Clean URLs without extensions
- SEO-friendly structure
- Navigation through Next.js Link component

## Performance Considerations
- Image optimization through Next.js Image component
- Component code splitting
- Minimal client-side JavaScript where possible
- Optimized animations to prevent layout shifts

## Future Technical Directions
- API integration for form submissions
- Authentication for admin capabilities
- Server-side rendering for dynamic content
- Analytics integration for user tracking
